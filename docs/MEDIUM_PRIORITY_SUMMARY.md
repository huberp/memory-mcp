- Comprehensive validation for:
  - String inputs (with max length)
  - Arrays (with max items)
  - Tags (with specific constraints)
  - Conversation IDs
  - Numeric ranges

**Note:** Full Zod schema validation for database documents was not implemented to keep changes minimal. Current validation provides sufficient runtime safety for user inputs.

**Benefits:**
- Prevents invalid data from entering system
- Better error messages
- Runtime type safety
- Input sanitization

---

## Issues Not Implemented (Outside Scope)

The following issues were not implemented as they would require more substantial architectural changes:

### Issue #19: Loose Type for Memory Interface
**Reason:** Would require breaking changes to the Memory type and database schema. Current optional fields are necessary for backward compatibility and flexibility.

### Issue #23: Tight Coupling Between Orchestrator and Database
**Reason:** Implementing full dependency injection would require significant refactoring and could introduce complexity. Current implementation is testable via mocks.

### Issue #25: No Observability/Metrics
**Reason:** Would require integration with external monitoring systems. Should be implemented based on specific production requirements.

### Issue #26: No Circuit Breaker for Database
**Reason:** While valuable, circuit breaker pattern is a more advanced resilience feature. Current timeout configuration provides basic protection.
